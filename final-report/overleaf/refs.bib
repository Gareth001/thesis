abstract = {This study trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) incorporating an attention mechanism to predict daily sepsis, myocardial infarction (MI), and vancomycin antibiotic administration over two week patient ICU courses in the MIMIC-III dataset. These models achieved next-day predictive AUC of 0.876 for sepsis, 0.823 for MI, and 0.833 for vancomycin administration. Attention maps built from these models highlighted those times when input variables most influenced predictions and could provide a degree of interpretability to clinicians. These models appeared to attend to variables that were proxies for clinician decision-making, demonstrating a challenge of using flexible deep learning approaches trained with EHR data to build clinical decision support. While continued development and refinement is needed, we believe that such models could one day prove useful in reducing information overload for ICU physicians by providing needed clinical decision support for a variety of clinically important tasks.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have proven high accuracy for identifying melanoma in digitised dermoscopic images. A strength is that these methods are not constrained by features that are pre-defined by human semantics. A down-side is that it is difficult to understand the rationale of the model predictions and to identify potential failure modes. This is a major barrier to adoption of deep learning in clinical practice. In this paper we ask if two existing local interpretability methods, Grad-CAM and Kernel SHAP, can shed light on convolutional neural networks trained in the context of melanoma detection. Our contributions are (i) we first explore the domain space via a reproducible, end-to-end learning framework that creates a suite of 30 models, all trained on a publicly available data set (HAM10000), (ii) we next explore the reliability of GradCAM and Kernel SHAP in this context via some basic sanity check experiments (iii) finally, we investigate a random selection of models from our suite...},

abstract = {Modeling real-world multidimensional time series can be particularly challenging when these are sporadically observed (i.e., sampling is irregular both in time and across dimensions)-such as in the case of clinical patient data. To address these challenges, we propose (1) a continuous-time version of the Gated Recurrent Unit, building upon the recent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Chen et al., 2018), and (2) a Bayesian update network that processes the sporadic observations. We bring these two ideas together in our GRU-ODE-Bayes method. We then demonstrate that the proposed method encodes a continuity prior for the latent process and that it can exactly represent the Fokker-Planck dynamics of complex processes driven by a multidimensional stochastic differential equation. Additionally, empirical evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state of the art on both synthetic data and real-world data with applications in healthcare and climate forecast.

abstract = {Intensive care units (ICUs) face financial, bed management, and staffing constraints. Detailed data covering all aspects of patients' journeys into and through intensive care are now collected and stored in electronic health records: machine learning has been used to analyse such data in order to provide decision support to clinicians.
Systematic review of the applications of machine learning to routinely collected ICU data. Web of Science and MEDLINE databases were searched to identify candidate articles: those on image processing were excluded. The study aim, the type of machine learning used, the size of dataset analysed, whether and how the model was validated, and measures of predictive accuracy were extracted.
Of 2450 papers identified, 258 fulfilled eligibility criteria. The most common study aims were predicting complications (77 papers [29.8% of studies]), predicting mortality (70 [27.1%]), improving prognostic models (43 [16.7%]), and classifying sub-populations (29 [11.2%]). Median sample size was 488 (IQR 108-4099): 41 studies analysed data on > 10,000 patients. Analyses focused on 169 (65.5%) papers that used machine learning to predict complications, mortality, length of stay, or improvement of health. Predictions were validated in 161 (95.2%) of these studies: the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was reported by 97 (60.2%) but only 10 (6.2%) validated predictions using independent data. The median AUC was 0.83 in studies of 1000-10,000 patients, rising to 0.94 in studies of > 100,000 patients. The most common machine learning methods were neural networks (72 studies [42.6%]), support vector machines (40 [23.7%]), and classification/decision trees (34 [20.1%]). Since 2015 (125 studies [48.4%]), the most common methods were support vector machines (37 studies [29.6%]) and random forests (29 [23.2%]).
The rate of publication of studies using machine learning to analyse routinely collected ICU data is increasing rapidly. The sample sizes used in many published studies are too small to exploit the potential of these methods. Methodological and reporting guidelines are needed, particularly with regard to the choice of method and validation of predictions, to increase confidence in reported findings and aid in translating findings towards routine use in clinical practice.},

We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (N = 13), intrinsically interpretable models (N = 9), data dimensionality reduction (N = 8), attention mechanism (N = 7), and feature interaction and importance (N = 5).XAI evaluation is an open issue that requires a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals’ point of view.Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine.}",

The severity was apparently high, as shown by the high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (22, 17 to 29) and pneumonia severity index score (118, 88 to 151). XGBoost model (area under the curve (AUC): 0.842; 95\% CI 0.749 to 0.928) outperformed RF (AUC: 0.809; 95\% CI 0.629 to 0.891) and LR (AUC: 0.701; 95\% CI 0.573 to 0.825) for predicting 30-day mortality. To give clinicians an intuitive understanding of feature exploitation, we stratified features by the clinical domain. The cumulative feature importance in the fluid balance domain, ventilation domain, laboratory data domain, demographic and symptom domain, management domain and severity score domain was 0.253, 0.113, 0.177, 0.140, 0.152 and 0.165, respectively. We further used SHAP plots to illustrate associations between features and 30-day mortality in critically ill influenza patients.Conclusions We used a real-world data set and applied an ML approach, mainly XGBoost, to establish a practical and explainable mortality prediction model in critically ill influenza patients.},

abstract = {In intensive care unit (ICU), it is essential to predict the mortality of patients and mathematical models aid in improving the prognosis accuracy. Recently, recurrent neural network (RNN), especially long short-term memory (LSTM) network, showed advantages in sequential modeling and was promising for clinical prediction. However, ICU data are highly complex due to the diverse patterns of diseases; therefore, instead of single LSTM model, an ensemble algorithm of LSTM (eLSTM) is proposed, utilizing the superiority of the ensemble framework to handle the diversity of clinical data. The eLSTM algorithm was evaluated by the acknowledged database of ICU admissions Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). The investigation in total of 18415 cases shows that compared with clinical scoring systems SAPS II, SOFA, and APACHE II, random forests classification algorithm, and the single LSTM classifier, the eLSTM model achieved the superior performance with the largest value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8451 and the largest area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.4862. Furthermore, it offered an early prognosis of ICU patients. The results demonstrate that the eLSTM is capable of dynamically predicting the mortality of patients in complex clinical situations.},

abstract = {In Intensive Care Units (ICU), the machine learning technique has been widely used in ICU patient data. A mortality risky model can provide assessment on patients’ current and when the disease may worsen. The prediction of mortality outcomes even intervenes doctor’s decision making on patient’s treatment. Based on the patient’s condition, a timely intervention treatment is adopted to prevent the patient’s condition gets worse. However, the common major challenges in ICU patient data are irregular data sampling and missing variables values. In this paper, we used a statistical approach to preprocess the data. We introduced a data imputation method based on Gaussian process and proposed a deep learning technology using LSTM-RUN that emphasizes on long time dependency relation inside the patient data records to predict the probability of patient’s mortality in ICU. The experiment results show that LSTM improved the mortality prediction accuracy than base RNN using the new statistical imputation method for handling missing data problem.},

abstract = {Real-time prediction of mortality for intensive care unit patients has the potential to provide physicians with a simple and easily interpretable synthesis of patient acuity. Here we extract data from a random time during each patient's ICU stay. We believe this sampling scheme allows for the application of the model(s) across a future patient's entire ICU stay. The AUROC of a Gradient Boosting model was high (AUROC=0.920), even though no information about diagnosis or comorbid burden was utilized. We also compare models using data from the first 24 hours of a patient's stay against published severity of illness scores, and find the Gradient Boosting model greatly outperformed the frequently used Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (AUROC = 0.927 vs. 0.809). We nuance this performance with comparison to the literature, provide our interpretation, and discuss potential avenues for improvement.},
